This is a forked `pallet-contracts` crate from ParityTech.
It is used to support current development of the [DRink! project](https://github.com/Cardinal-Cryptography/drink/).

Since release process of Substrate crates is still not fully developed nor very frequent, for now we will depend on this fork and bring here any required features from the upstream code.
